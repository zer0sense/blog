The holidays are here, and with that being said, the new years resolutions are about to be abundant. Have you thought of how you can change your digital life? I would like to make a suggestion for you go consider, and why I think it will be a great start to taking your information back and safe. 

To my surprise CISA (The Cyber Defense Agency for the US) released a [resource](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/mobile-communications-best-practice-guidance) for a mobile communication best practice PDF. The first recommendation talking point refers to using only end-to-end encryption for communication. That sounds great!!! What does that mean? End-to-end encryption means that the connection and communication are directly between the clients with no one in the middle of the communication. Think of it like talking in a closed room with nobody else listening. Comparing this to when you call someone there is a telecommunication providing connection __Through__ them. This means that someone can potentially listen or record your conversations.

The biggest obstacle for any secure communication application is adoption.

I can hear it now. Yes, you have nothing to hide. You're the pinnacle of excellence, and nobody could ever want to know what you're talking about.

Why signal over other secure communication apps like Whatsapp and Telegram?
