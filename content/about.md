# Introduction

I am a nerd, an IT professional, a US Air Force veteran, and an aspiring cyber security professional. I enjoy a wide range of IT topics, but the goal is to be an ethical hacker and penetration tester. I was very fortunate to get into IT. I had no prior experience, no certifications, and had little projects to teach myself some fundamentals. Luckily, I was able to get my foot in the door, and I plan to make the most of it. 
# The Reason for This Blog

It's my time to give back. A lot of content creators I follow encourage people who are new to share their experience. I consume a ton of content from Youtube, podcasts, and Google. Why not blog about what I find interesting, and what projects I plan on taking on, and my cyber security journey. This also selfishly serves as a reference point to come back to instead of having a favorites tab in Firefox that a mile long. 

I would like to thank you for taking the time to stop by this blog. I hope that you find it helpful with whatever brought you here, and that you can also share to your experience as well.
